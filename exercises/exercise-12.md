# Exercise 12

1. Upgrade the Car Tool to use a database data service. Do not implement the `replace` method. I will demo that in class.

2. Add a configuration option to the `appsettings.json` file to choose either the in-memory or database services. Update the `program.cs` logic to use the configuration value.

3. Ensure it works!
